## Installation

* Download ZIP from Github.
* Upload ZIP to your blog (Appearance > Themes > Add New Theme).
* Activate theme.
* Use WordPress Customizer live preview to personalize your theme.
* You can enable a stream toggle to filter Tweets with and without replies by following the instructions in stream_toggle.php.

## Known issues

* Customizer sometimes doesn't recognize a property if you keep it the same as the default. If things aren't showing up properly, edit the field in Customizer, hit Publish, and hard refresh the page.
